**9/30 essay: Go to the Gapminder data site (founded by Hans Rosling). The x and y axes can be changed with the little arrows. The year can be changed with the slider at the bottom. You can even have the plot play through time. Each bubble represents a nation and can be selected and deselected in the right panel. There's a two minute "How to" video at the top as well.**

Pick at least one configuration (life expectancy vs income in the UK and Cuba over the past 80 years, for example). Try any combination(s) you like (no wrong answers here). Write what data you are displaying. Write about what you see or what surprises you, if anything. As best you can, connect what you see to ideas in previous readings from Rosling, West, Sen, another course, or from your experience. You have until 10:15.


Firstly, I choose to pick a bar graph showing the trend of comparison between income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation adjusted) vs time (years) for the United States, Russia, China, and Nigeria. For the most part according to the trend, what I saw made relative sense. Since the 1800s, the United States has seen a steady rise in income per person, besides one specific date: The Great Depression. When the Great Depression began in 1929, we saw an immediate fall in income per person in the United States, a small kink the graph though long terms. In addition, Russia has seen a steady climb in GDP, but not as steadily as the United States. In 1919 and 1989, Russia saw two major trenches in data with GDP taking a sharp negative turn. 

On a different note, Nigeria and China were definitely of a slight surprise to me. From 1800 to approximately 1960, Nigeria essentially saw no growth in GDP per capita. But from 1960 to 2018, given a few minor ups and downs in the data, Nigeria has seen quite a steady rise in GDP per capita. My best guess for why this is is that Nigeria has had quite a bit of help from other nations around the world to stimulate their economy. Another guess could be that certain high tariffs and taxes may have been removed slowly but surely in the country, giving consumers more disposable income to further stimulate the economy (this is called expansionary fiscal policy).

The trend with China is actually rather interesting, and to be honest, slightly scary. I remember in Rosling’s TedTalk, he brought up the “looming ghost of China'' towards the end of the show when he presented two bell-curve distributions. The distributions showed average median household income for China and the USA. As he increased time going from past to present and then present to future, the trend was clear: average median household income in China has been and will continue to (at the current rate of growth) increase at a larger rate than the USA. This is where you were able to visualize the bell-curve “ghost” shape slowly making a gain on the bell-curve of the United States. Back to the data trend I observed today, though, it is crazy how steep and constant of a slope China has from 1989 to present of an increase in GDP per capita. Since approximately 1989, GDP per capita with inflation adjusted has increased from only $1500, to over $16,000. Using the slope equation, that is a rise of approximately $483.33 each year! 

Connecting to the reading from West, this logically makes sense for China in relation to all the different growth initiatives they are taking. One example I read in West’s story was how China is attempting to create 300 new cities in excess of a million people each within only a 20 year time frame. While this may appear slightly crazy to do in only 20 years, it is initiatives like these that China somehow continues to take on that have stimulated its growth. Over the next 20 years, and even 5 to 10 years, it will be interesting to analyze the growth trends in income and GDP between each country. In order to “out race” China, the USA will need to continue to innovate, build, and find unique ways to out-perform China if we want to be the world’s economic superpower. Something that is also very important to think about is, and we must keep in mind, is that China does have over a billion people living in the nation, relative to only approximately 330 million people in the United States.

In addition, just for a little fun, I selected all the different island nations in the Caribbean to compare their GDP per capita vs time. It was crazy to see how closely similar the numbers and trends were for each island nation, besides Haiti of course. Each nation has seen steady growth since the 1980s, except for Haiti which has seen a decline. For this area of the world, I believe this trend shows one important idea comparing Haiti to the rest of the island nations: when tourism is limited in a given tropical location, this is the impact.
