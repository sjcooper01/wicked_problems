**10/12 Essay: Read this press article on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a Chinese global infrastructure development plan. What are your thoughts, or more saliently, what questions do you have or what would you want to know/learn more about? What responsibilities do you think the international community should have on such matters? You have until 10:10.

After reading this article, my first initial realization is that they used AidData from students right here at the College of William and Mary! I found this fact really interesting that the Wall Street Journal, a credible and highly respected news source, cited findings from students right here at our college!
  
But what I found even more interesting is the statistic that was brought up right away: “AidData, a research center at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., counted 42 low- and middle-income countries that now have debt exposure to China exceeding 10% of their annual gross domestic product” (Areddy 3). The question I have for China is, is it worth the risk to be lending money to these countries? How will these middle and low income countries pay back the debt? Many of these countries are already in pre-existing debt and have been for many years. I find it quite surprising that China would have faith in 42 different countries that may never pay them back, a rather large risk to take.
  
As the article progresses, I came across additional information and statistics that made me even more surprised and slightly worried. Arredy states “the report also estimates 35% of China’s overseas infrastructure projects have faced major problems like corruption scandals, labor violations, environmental hazards and public pushback. AidData links almost 400 projects valued at $8.3 billion to China’s military” (Arredy 7). This statistic has me rather concerned for the nation of China - are they just throwing money away and expecting something to come out of it? Or, do these initiatives have some type of benefit for the nation that we just are not sure about? Having 400 projects overseas, with many that have faced problems like corruption scandals, labor violations, and environmental hazards is very concerning. I am curious to learn what some of these initiatives entail and which can be viewed as the most corrupt. 
  
As I made my way towards the end of the article, I came across yet another paragraph of interesting information. The paragraph states “Mr. Xi addressed a persistent international concern in his U.N. address this month by saying China would stop building coal-fired power plants abroad, and pledging to help other nations diversify their energy sources. The president also proposed a Global Development Initiative that would feature debt suspension and development aid for vulnerable nations facing exceptional difficulties” (Arredy 18). As I learned my Senior year of high school, China is the biggest producer and user of coal in the entire world. The fact that President Xi stated they would stop building coal-fired power plants abroad is a major environmental bonus for our Earth. Coal can be and has been very bad for our planet, and if China is the start of a movement to get rid of coal plants, that would be exceptional. The question is, though, will China actually follow through with what Xi stated? In addition, it was also stated that their Global Development Initiative would have debt suspension for burdened nations and additional aid for suffering nations. China, like the United States, is a very advanced country. If both nations would work together on a project like this, I believe that this would be a major success. I believe that the responsibilities of the international community should pertain to environmental preservation efforts, in addition to making sure nations like China stick to their agreements and promises.
  
Lastly, I found it interesting and kind of scandalous that China does not officially define or quantify Belt and Road projects. It is clear what they are doing and how they are doing it, but they don’t make it clear to the press and the rest of the world. The second to last paragraph explains “Chinese lenders had begun building safeguards into many loans by syndicating them between multiple banks to reduce risks and tying more of them to commodity-supply agreements. Mr. Parks said it is ultimately unclear who is most exposed to Chinese lending” (Areddy 22). The international community and nations around the world deserve to feel slightly concerned with China’s behavior. With a lack of clarity comes improper behavior, and China may very well be up to something. It is also concerning that we aren’t sure who is most exposed to lending, China or the borrowing country. Might China be engaging in this behavior to benefit in some way?
