**10/7 Essay: I want to introduce you to another source of sociology-focused data: Our World in Data, founded by Max Roser. Select a topic you are curious about from the dropdown "Articles by topic". Technological Progress, for example. If the topic is lengthy, you can pick just a graph or two. Two cool things about the site are (1) there are concise descriptions of the topics, definitions of terms, and references; and (2) most ( if not all) the plots have their data available for download as a csv. Their COVID plots are some of the best and up-to-date. This one, for example, is robust with its many metrics, but it's simple and easy to manipulate as well. Similar to 9/30's essay, write what topic (or graph(s)) you are looking at. Describe what you see. Are there trends? If so, what are they? Does anything surprise you? Where possible, connect what you see to previous readings, discussions, or your experiences. You have until 10:15**

I choose to research natural disasters, as this topic specifically relates to what I am researching for my literature. Right away, I learned that Natural disasters kill on average 60,000 people per year and are responsible for 0.1% of global deaths, but this number can vary strongly from year to year. 
  
The website with this topic provided a lot of useful information in regards to natural disasters. A clear trend I analyzed was that those at low incomes are often the most vulnerable to disaster events, and improving living standards, infrastructure and response systems in these regions will be key to preventing deaths from natural disasters in the coming decades. In addition, I learned that disasters affect those in poverty most heavily - high death tolls tend to be centered in low-to-middle income countries without the infrastructure to protect and respond to events. One specific graph towards the beginning of the article, entitled “Deaths from natural disasters as a share of total deaths, 2017” showed these trends clearly. Nations like Iran, Columbia, Haiti and Mexico were all highlighted in the aqua color, conveying that they have had some of the most disaster deaths in relation to the rest of the world. These specific nations generally have limited availability and access to new infrastructure, poor response efforts, low incomes, and poor healthcare systems. This point highlights an important idea we learned about in our previous reading with Amartya Sen: each of the unfreedoms that a nation has are interconnected in some way. One unfreedom leads to another, which leads to another, and so on so forth.
  
Another interesting graph that was quite impactful was towards the middle of the article, showing the global annual deaths from natural disasters by decade. On a global scale over a country scale, it is amazing just how far we have come. Over the course of the 20th century, we saw a significant decline in global deaths from natural disasters. In the early 1900s, the annual average was often in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the second half of the century and into the early 2000s, we have seen a significant decline to less than 100,000 – at least five times lower than these peaks. Some of the biggest death tolls each year back in the early 1900s were a result of droughts and floods, taking hundreds of thousands of lives each decade. Now, we essentially see a very small number of deaths from these events, and I find this shocking. According to the stacked bar chart, most of our natural disaster deaths come from earthquakes. 
  
One last graphic that I found quite shocking was the displacement of people from natural disasters by nation in 2020. The United States had over 1.7 million people either injured, left homeless, or needing some form of major assistance after a disaster. This is quite a large number of people. China had almost 5.1 million people, a larger number most likely due to their high population number. Again, it is clear that, relative to total population, those who have increased income disparity and poverty had a larger displacement of people after natural disasters.
