**10/21 Essay: After Dan's lecture, I would like to reinstall a bit of empirical optimism regarding the progress of humanity. Despite the very real difficulties data scientists, humanitarians, developers, and other leaders face, progress is being made over large time scales. Go to this website (a supplement to Peter Diamandis's 2012 book "Abundance") which illustrates various forms of progress across multiple dimensions of human well-being. Pick a topic heading. Write a description of each of the trends you see, i.e., for each figure. Do you think each trend actually represents progress? If not, why do you think? Finally, with Dan and A. Sen in mind, what do you think could be barriers to progress in each topic? (another way to think about this is: why do you think progress hasn't occurred even more rapidly?) You have until 10:15.**

For my topic heading, I choose to go with Increasing Learning and Literacy. There are a total of 10 different trends to be analyzed. The first trend shows a projection of the total world population by level of education. As time progresses, the trend shows an increase in people who have upper secondary education, and a decrease in people who receive no education. The second and eighth graph show the trend of the literate vs. illiterate population since 1800 and the sharp increase in the literate population across the world. The third trend shows that child labor and hazardous work across the world is on the decline, and the fourth shows that average years of education across the world has risen since 1820. The fifth graph shows the trend of illiteracy among ethnic groups in the USA since 1900, and how the literacy rate has leveled off between white and minority people. Graphs six and seven both convey that higher education rates have risen across the world, and less and less people each year finish their education after high school. The ninth graph shows how for each nation represented within the graph, mean years of schooling have risen with a positive, mostly linear trend. Graph ten uses a bar chart to show the rise in literacy rate by country since 1475, which has risen from an average of 10% in 1475 to an average of approximately 98% in 2015.
  
I do believe that each graphical display implies some sort of progress. Progress within a nation and across our world can be seen in a variety of different ways. A rise in literacy and education rates are one important indicator of human progress as they allow us to communicate effectively and efficiently, increase the productivity, progress, and welfare within a society. Every graph shows some type of positive trend in relation to schooling and education, whether it be a rise in literacy rates, rise in mean years of schooling, or reduction in people finishing school after high school and an increase in college graduation rates. But, what is important to keep in mind is that a variety of these graphs were not just centered for specific nations, but rather the entire world. While trends might be positive on a global scale, this does not mean that certain nations like Kenya or Afghanistan have seen negative trends due to outside factors and limitations. While each trend might represent progress on average, some nations have seen a fall in literacy rate and people attending school, for example, in African nations where people have to direct their time and effort to other things like collecting clean drinking water. It is important to note that opportunities are not given equally in each nation.
  
In terms of why progress may not have occurred even more rapidly, there are outside pressures and confounding variables that may have influenced the trends I examined from the graphs. Amartya Sen explains in his writing that in order to have a maximized level of progress, removal of the basic unfreedoms that impact oneâ€™s ability to impact society must be removed. One basic unfreedom like having inadequate food, water, or other supplies leads to another, for example, not being able to go to school and get an education. It is factors and unfreedoms like this that convey the reality of why progress has not occurred even faster. A maximum level of progress depends on the fact that people are able to work at the most efficient rate possible without any limitations. But within almost all nations, there are people who deal with different limitations that impact the overall progress within the country. Likewise in relation to what I learned from Dan, sometimes we have the innovative technology and information we need, but there are times where certain factors, like people, can limit us. Dan and his group had that detailed study all in place, but the attorney general and system at the government level kept standing in their way. Time kept moving forward, and they were at a standstill with what they were able to do with the study.
