What did Hons Rosling do about his survey of the new students at the Karolinska Institute and how they compared with the results from the Chimpanzees (as well as the faculty who decided the Nobel)? What is the significance of the results from his formal survey on preconceived ideas?

- Hons Rolsing's survey about the Chimpanzees showed that after using statistical analysis, Swedish students know less about the world than Chimpanzees (their mean was 1.8 +_ 0.4, while the chimpanzees had a mean of 2.5). But what was even more interesting was that compared with the Swedish professors, the Chimpanzees were exactly on par (mean of 2.5 vs mean of 2.4 +_ 0.4). The significance of these results, as Hans states, is "the need to communicate the data and its importance". These results also show that humans develop preconceived ideas about the world which influence us strongly. 

What type of change took place in Asia proceeding economic growth?

- Before the economic boom in Asia, large quantities of people were in poverty (while many are still today, this statistic is still diminishing). Proceeding economic growth in Asia, a few different types of change took place according to Rosling. Not only did Real GDP per capita increase due to a better standard of living, but child mortality rate also decreased (higher survival rate) due to a better economy with better medicine and healthcare. Everyday, more and more people were breaking above the poverty line.

In accordance with Hans Rosling’s TED talk, what is the relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita?

- According to Hans Rosling, as the GDP per capita increased and people were able to enjoy a better standard of living, the child mortality rate actually went down and children had a better chance of surviving. With a higher GDP per capita, citizens have additional disposable income available at their fingertips to use on other necessities like access to better healthcare/medicines.

In terms of income distribution, how has the world changed from 1962 until 2003?

- From 1962 to 2003, income distribution has slowly but steadily been moving toward a more centered, symmetrical distribution on a logarithmic scale (more equality). While this does not necessarily hold true for all regions like east and south Asia have made major improvements towards more income equality (more of a centered distribution/bell-curve). 

What is the significance of how Hans Rosling uses data to describe global human development in terms of very high spatial and temporal resolution?

- From what I gathered in Hans Rosling’s TED talk presentation, the significance behind what he shows us is related to the data being available, but the public not being able to grasp it. At the 15 minute mark in his video, Hans provides a very simple yet impactful image with the sun representing the public, the internet being the blue sky, and the National/UN data being underground. The symbolism is that the data is being “hidden” underground from the public, and as the world continues to change in relation to topics like spatial/temporal data, the ability to use this data effectively and efficiently is going to be key. 

In your opinion, why was Hans Rosling’s work with the Gapminder project significant to the remarkable process in the area of data science and human development?

- Personally, I think Hans’s final graphic relating to income distribution between China and the United States relates to this question. We live in a world among nations where competition drives determination and excellence. Project’s like the Gapminder project are not only significant to the study of data science, but it also gets “other nations on their feet” to show the world what they have accomplished. By engaging in futuristic/innovative projects like this one, other countries may be motivated to fund other projects in order to keep up with an ever-changing world. This overall impacts human development and can indirectly benefit us all.
