### INTRODUCTION
Hey everyone! My name is Sam Cooper, and I am frome Newburyport, Massachusetts. I plan on majoring both in Economics and Finance. I am interested in meterology, the study of weather, and love spending time by/in the ocean! I have a German Shepard girl named Stella who can't see or hear. A fun fact about me is that I despise coffee. My hometown is know for having the first oyster cracker.
