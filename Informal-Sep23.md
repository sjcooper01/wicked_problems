Human development has been described by Selim Jahan (head of the UNDP program) as “development of the people (capital), for the people (translated to the lives of people) and by the people (people are not only receiving but active participants in the process).” How have we done as a humanity to fulfill this hope originally manifested through the Gettysburg address? Does data science have a role to play in advancing the human condition? What role does complexity play in advancing our understanding of global human development processes and their multitude of dimensions? In order to predict valuable solutions to some of the world's most intractable problems, will combined domain expertise from the perspective of computer science & statistics with global human development be sufficient, or is a new integrated paradigm needed? What hope do we have in selecting the best future path for humanity?

Throughout the entire world and the course of human history, different groups of people have faced and continue to face unique challenges that impact their identity. As Amartya Sen explains in his writing Development As Freedom, freedom depends not only on GDP, income or with technology/industrialization advancements. Freedom also relates to social and economic arrangements, political and civil rights, and the removal of basic unfreedom that takes away our ability to contribute to an ever-changing world. As the Gettysburg address implies when it is said by the people, people are not only receiving, but are active participants in the process of development. When this ability to actively participate is taken away and impacts one's ability to positively contribute to development and growth, an entire nation is impacted, and indirectly the entire world. On page eight of Amartya Sen’s writing piece, he brings in a personal anecdote relating to a man in Nepal who desired to go and work for his family. In Nepal, people experience many of the political, social, and economic freedoms everyday. Amartya was playing in his garden as a younger boy, and remembered seeing this man being attacked by a violent gang. What was this man supposed to do? Due to the lack of economic opportunity, he was not only forced to work in an area that lacked safety to support his family, but indirectly as a result, he then had to figure out a way to seek medical attention in an area where healthcare facilities are neglected (one of the basic freedoms according to Sen). This relationship further conveys another idea that challenges someone's ability to contribute to the “development of people” and capital: One basic unfreedom leads to another, and this cycle can be never-ending for people in certain nations with tyranny, poor economic progress, social unrest, and instability. People desperately want to escape this continuous cycle of unfreedom, but they are inhibited from doing so on many different accounts.

Data science, the field that refers to the collective processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies that enable the review, analysis and extraction of valuable knowledge and information from raw data, is key in advancing the human condition. The human condition is all of the characteristics and key events that compose the essentials of human existence, including birth, growth, emotion, aspiration, conflict, and mortality. Data science and the implied statistics that coincide with them allow us to directly study these topics, indirectly helping our society. In Hans Rosling’s Ted Talk, we were able to observe how he used data science practices to show correlations between fertility rates and other factors through nations around the world. Without certain data science practices, observing certain relationships wouldn’t be as efficient and achievable. Likewise, through my research, I have learned about the importance of geospatial data science methods like clustering in tracking those after natural disasters. Using mobile operator geospatial data and the data science method of clustering, organizations like Flowminder and Digicel have been able to track population density and mobility after the earthquake in Haiti, a small island nation in the Hispañola area of the Caribbean. They were able to use geospatial maps and local cell towers to track how people moved across the nation in response to tragedy, directly relating to the idea of mobility and the need for stronger government involvement during and after natural disasters. No evacuation plan was put into place for residents of Haiti, and citizens were forced to fend for themselves. Data science practices and aggregated sampling allowed them to track thousands of people, in which they were able to find these people and give them help.

In terms of combined domain expertise from the perspective of computer science and statistics with global human development, as our world continues to expand and grow in complexity, we will need to continue to develop new models. In my environmental field studies class Senior year, we learned about the idea of overpopulation, one of the biggest threats to humanity: “It is only logical that an increase in the world’s population will cause additional strains on resources. More people means an increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, healthcare, transportation, and more. And all that consumption contributes to ecological degradation, increased conflicts, and a higher risk of large-scale disasters like pandemics” (Overpopulation 8). How are we going to use data science to predict this or show the impacts? While we have simple models to show exponential human growth and the depreciation of resources, we have no algorithm that can predict or show future environmental impacts on human development around the world. Environmental change, that is, for example, an increase in natural disasters, sea level rise, temperatures, and droughts, is one of the biggest problems human beings face today. We have the power to control it, but ironically, many nations still fail to observe this fact. We can prevent this issue from getting any worse, but once we have made our impact, many things could be irreversible to the human race. Instead of just having scattered nations with different levels of unfreedom, our entire world will be one, gargantuan sphere of unfreedom. Nobody will be able to escape the unfreedom that many of us in the United States take for granted. Thus, developing new models and statistics in relation to environmental impacts and climate change is going to be crucial to human development and preservation of our only home.
