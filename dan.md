Can you explain the Weighted Ordered Average Technique a little more depth? What made this technique the best for this study? Were there other potential techniques you could have used?

What is a Monte Carlo robustness analysis, and how did you incorporate it into this study?

Did the results from this study differ from what you were expecting? If so, what were you expecting with your prior knowledge from this study?

In part 2.1 titled “Aggregation and Tradeoff”, you talked about how an implicitly optimistic assessment (type II errors, false negatives) may result in missed mitigation opportunities. What are type II errors, and what are examples in the context of this study?

The region that I come from in Massachusetts, Essex county, appears to have one of the lowest and if not the lowest WOWA score in the entire country (according to Figure 3 and Figure 4, between 0.11 and 0.2). Can you explain what this means in the context of your study? Why did it receive such a low score?

In your “Discussion and Conclusion” section, you talk about primary concerns of uncertainty, and how the WOWA index approach is subject to error. Your first concern stated “the spatial scale of analysis and related Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) concerns.” Can you please explain this in more depth and detail? What is the background of MAUP?
